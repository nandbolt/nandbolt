### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- âš¡ I'm currently a 3rd year computational physics major at the University of Texas at Austin.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finishing Monster Cycle, a top-down action arena game about climbing up the monster ladder. It started as a jam game and is made in PICO-8.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focusing my efforts on learning Python and C++ and am hoping to have 2 relevant projects in each language soon!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about GameMaker, procedural level generation, enemy AI and physics
- ðŸ“« How to reach me:
      - [discord](https://discord.com/users/389247859578634241)

Most of the cool things I do are located on my game page [here](https://nandbolt.itch.io/).
