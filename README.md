### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- âš¡ I'm currently a 3rd year computational physics major at the University of Texas at Austin.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finishing Monster Cycle, a top-down action arena game about climbing up the monster ladder. It started as a jam game and is made in PICO-8.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focusing my efforts on learning Python and C++ and am hoping to have 2 relevant projects in each language soon!
- ðŸŽ® Some of my favorite aspects that I enjoy working on in video game development is procedural level generation, enemy AI and game physics.
