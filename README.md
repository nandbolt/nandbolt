   > I studied computational physics at the University of Texas at Austin.
   > I have 4+ years of independent game development experience.
   > My preferred game engine for solo projects is GameMaker Studio 2.
   > I’m currently trying to master C# with Unity.
   > I'm currently working on several different projects, including:
+      > V-Shift, an online multiplayer 2D battle platformer on Steam now, with a talented team at Propel Studios.
+      > A game utilizing a 2D physics engine I made in GameMaker Studio 2 (nbphysics) set to release on Steam this year.
   > Ask me about GameMaker, procedural level generation and physics.
