### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- âš¡ I'm currently a 4th year computational physics major at the University of Texas at Austin.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 2 large projects with GameMaker Studio 2:
  - Graphmatical: A complete remake of my graphing calculator platformer ILIAGC with a new emphasis on fun, learning, user-generated content and general improvements to everything.
  - A secret action game that will be larger in scope than any of my past projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focusing my efforts on mastering Python and C++.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about GameMaker, procedural level generation, enemy AI and physics.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me:
      - [discord](https://discord.com/users/389247859578634241)
      - [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-wilson-b5097916a/)

Most of the cool things I do are located on my game page [here](https://nandbolt.itch.io/).
